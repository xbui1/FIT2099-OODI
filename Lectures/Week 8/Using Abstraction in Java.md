## Using Abstraction at Code Level
- Abtraction is a **design principle** rather than a _programming technique_
- You do not have to write generic classes in this unit

## Features of Java
### Class
- is the most important mechnaism in most OO Languages (incl. Java)
    - represent single concept
    - expose a public interface that allows response in order to furfill its responsiblity
    - hide any implemntation details that don't directly fullfil that responsiblity
    - ensutre that its attribution are in a valid condition rather than relying  on client code to maintain its state
