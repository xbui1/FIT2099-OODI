# Sample Exam 20177

## Question 1
_You have joined a team that is working on a fully-featured version of the Star Wars game, 
complete with a graphical user interface, for commercial release.  It’s planned to re-use the engine 
code (which has gained a lot of new features, including GUI support) for similar games in the 
future._

_The game runs reasonably well, but when you look at the engine code you discover that it contains 
a lot of “cut-and-paste reuse” – that is, repeated similar sequences of code, sometimes with a few 
very small changes._

### Part A
_Why do software engineers consider repeated code to be a bad thing?  Write a 
paragraph or two about the risks of cut-and-paste reuse. (6 marks)_ 

It firstly violates the DRY principle, by violating the DRY principle it means by making a small change within one part of the repeated code, you may need to change more than one component. 
Another factor is that by cutting and pasting code, it will increase the risk of introducing bugs, memory leaks and other factors into your code. 

## Part B
_Describe how you would go about fixing the code to reduce these risks. (6 marks)_
