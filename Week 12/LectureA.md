# 1. Software Architecture
## 1.1. Consists of 
- Elements (What)
- Form (How) 
   - properties (constraints on elemnts and system)
   - relationship
- Rationale (Why?)
   - reasoning behind software design

## 1.2. Abstractions
- most important concept

## 1.3. Architect
- Describe Structure and System
- Level of abstraction is chosen such that all critical design decisions are apparent and meaningful
- Specified by
    - Design Diagrams
    - Component Abstractions

## 1.4. Architecture and Design

## 1.5. Design Decisions
- Structure
- Behaviour
- Interaction
- Non Functional Properties
    - Quality Attributes
    
## 1.6. Quality Attrivutes
- Reliatblity
- Availability
- Scalibility 
- Portability
- Performance
- ...
- Part of NFRs

## 1.7. Quality Attribute Spec
- Architecture are often told:
- Far too imprecise


## Performance 
- Measure latency 
- Important metric

## Scalability
- Request Load
- Connections
- Data Size
- Deployments
